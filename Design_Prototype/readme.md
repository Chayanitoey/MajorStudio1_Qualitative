# Design & Prototype Qualitative Assignment

After last week sketch review, I have decided to go forward with the 'tracking trash' idea. 
The goal of the visualization is to show where the waste we generated goes / how it gets disposed everyday. It is an idea that continues the exploration in SDG goal 12 which aligns with the previous project, 'Waste World'. 



For the design aesthetic, this project will use the same styleguide as previous project.

## Hi-fidelity Sketch 
There are total of 10 scenes in this prototype, the preferred dimension of screen is '1920 * 1080'

### Data Sets
- ![WasteJourney](https://chayanitoey.github.io/MajorStudio1/) - This infographic / flowchart shows a complex system of how waste usually being managed in a global scale. For this assignment, I will only focus on the center to the blue components due to data availability. 
- [Report from UNstats.org](https://linktodocumentation) - Manual on the Basic Set of Environment Statistics of the FDES 2013,Generation and Management of Waste. The data from this report is used to create informative description on the waste management process. 
- [Municipal waste treatment (latest year)](https://linktodocumentation)  - This file is downloaded from https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators.cshtml, we will be using the percentage of waste per country by treatment in the data visualization.

## Coding Progress


```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```


### Next steps :

- Working on scale bar corresponding with the amount of circles flowing in each nodes. 
- Working on scrolly telling components
