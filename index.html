        	    <h2>Tracing the journey of ‘ trash ’ from your bin to the its final destination*</h2>
        	    <p>
        	     Have you ever wondered where the things you threw in the trash end up at?<br>
        	     How does our waste management system even work? In this 'data-viz-article', we will explore the small version of waste management system and learn where the waste we generated end up at each destination; from landfill to composting. 
        	     Each country often has a very unique system due to its waste management system and amount of waste generated, either from housholds or commercial entities. 
        	     Because we want to compare globally and see many countries all at once, the waste management process needed to be generalized and simplified for better comprehension...

                <p>First Step is the <b>‘Waste Collection’</b> : 
                <br><br>
                <!--In year <b id = 'year'>YEAR</b>, <b id = 'countryName'>COUNTRYNAME</b> has a total of <b id ='wasteCollected'></b> tonnes of municipal waste collected.-->
                Waste generated is not always collected by waste collection services, and it may be treated or disposed of by the economic units or households.
                Therefore, the amount of generated waste is often larger than the amount of formally collected waste.
                 <br><br>
                <b>From 'Waste Collection' to 'Exportation'</b>
                 <br><br>
                 Every year, thousands of shipping containers filled with recyclable waste are exported by wealthy countries to developing countries. This is because it is typically cheaper to export waste rather than develop local recycling infrastructures. 
                It also reduces landfilling and can be lucrative for importers.

                 <p> <b>Waste Pretreatment</b>
                 <br><br>
                   The pretreatment processes are relatively straightforward and involve several stages of sorting, separating, size reduction, and in some cases, biological treatment. Capital costs for the pretreatment systems are moderate and generally worth the benefit of making a low-cost, readily available feedstock stream available

                    <b>Incineration to generate energy :</b>
                     <br><br>
                      consists in the controlled combustion of waste with energy recovery. Energy recovery means that evolving thermal energy is used for the production of steam, hot water or electric energy.

                    <b>Composting : </b>
                      <br><br>
                    refers to a biological process that submits biodegradable waste to anaerobic (biomethanization) or aerobic decomposition, and that results in a product that is recovered and can be used to increase soil fertility (products are compost and biogas).

               <!--   is defined as any waste management operation that diverts a waste material from the waste stream and which results in a certain product with a potential economic or ecological benefit. Recovery mainly refers to the following operations: material recovery, i.e., recycling, energy recovery, i.e., re-use as fuel, biological recovery, e.g., composting, methanisation and re-use.-->

                  <br><br>
                  The final placement of waste into or onto the land in a controlled or uncontrolled way. The definition covers both landfilling in internal sites (i.e., where a generator of waste is carrying out its own waste disposal at the place of generation) and in external sites.                    <br><br>
                  <b>Incineration</b>
                  <br><br>
                    consists in the controlled combustion of waste without energy recovery.

                  <b>Waste Recovery</b>
                  <br><br>
                    Any final treatment or disposal different from recycling, incineration and landfilling. Examples include physical/chemical treatment, biological treatment, releasing of waste into water bodies and permanent storage.
